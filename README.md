# ClinicConnect
Clinic Connect is an online booking portal for family clinic visit.This portal allows patients to browse the doctor's profiles and book appointments conveniently. The information of each doctor's profile includes their specialties, qualification and experience. The system will show real-time schedules, meaning you may only make an appointment during its doctors ' available hours which avoids double-booking.
